# Loan Calculations Fix - Migration Guide

## Overview
This migration fixes the total payable amount and remaining balance calculations for all existing loans in your system. The issue was that the calculation wasn't including the `recurring_fee` component.

## What Gets Fixed

### Before Migration ❌
```
Total Payable = Loan Amount + Interest Amount
```

### After Migration ✅
```
Total Payable = Loan Amount + Interest Amount + Recurring Fee
Remaining Balance = Total Payable - Total Payments Made
```

## Files Included

1. **migrations/002_fix_loan_calculations.sql** - SQL migration file
2. **fix_loan_calculations_migration.js** - Node.js script to run the migration

## How to Run the Migration

### Option 1: Using Node.js Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the migration script
node fix_loan_calculations_migration.js
```

**Advantages:**
- Shows real-time progress
- Displays sample of updated loans
- Shows statistics before/after
- Automatic transaction handling with rollback on error
- Creates detailed audit trail

### Option 2: Using psql (Direct SQL)

```bash
# Connect to your database and run the SQL migration
psql -d your_database_name < migrations/002_fix_loan_calculations.sql
```

### Option 3: Using pgAdmin or Database Client

1. Open your database connection tool
2. Copy the SQL from `migrations/002_fix_loan_calculations.sql`
3. Execute the entire script

## What the Migration Does

1. **Creates temporary column** for new calculations
2. **Recalculates total_payable_amount** for all loans:
   ```
   new_total = loan_amount + interest_amount + recurring_fee
   ```
3. **Recalculates remaining_balance** based on:
   - Total payable amount (newly calculated)
   - Minus total payments received
   - Ensures balance never goes negative
   - Sets redeemed loans to $0
4. **Cleans up** temporary columns
5. **Maintains data integrity** with transactions

## Safety Features

✅ **Transaction-based**: Uses BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK  
✅ **Automatic rollback**: If any error occurs, all changes are rolled back  
✅ **Non-destructive**: Only updates calculations, doesn't delete data  
✅ **Idempotent**: Can be run multiple times safely  
✅ **Audit logging**: Records migration in audit_logs table (if exists)

## Expected Results

### Sample Output:
```
✓ Transaction started
✓ Created temporary column: total_payable_amount_new
✓ Calculated new total_payable_amount for 45 loans
✓ Calculated payment totals for 45 loans
✓ Updated remaining_balance for 42 active loans
✓ Set remaining_balance to 0 for 3 redeemed loans
✓ Updated total_payable_amount for 45 loans
✓ Cleaned up temporary column

📈 Migration Statistics:
   Total loans: 45
   Active: 42 | Redeemed: 3 | Overdue: 0 | Forfeited: 0
   Total payable amount across all loans: $125,450.00
   Total remaining balance: $98,200.00

✅ Migration completed successfully!
```

## Verification After Migration

To verify the fix worked correctly, run this query:

```sql
-- Check if calculations are correct
SELECT 
  id,
  customer_name,
  loan_amount,
  interest_amount,
  recurring_fee,
  (loan_amount + COALESCE(interest_amount, 0) + COALESCE(recurring_fee, 0)) as expected_total,
  total_payable_amount,
  CASE 
    WHEN (loan_amount + COALESCE(interest_amount, 0) + COALESCE(recurring_fee, 0)) = total_payable_amount 
    THEN '✓ Correct'
    ELSE '✗ MISMATCH!'
  END as status
FROM loans
ORDER BY id DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

All rows should show "✓ Correct" in the status column.

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to undo the migration, restore from your most recent backup:

```bash
# Restore from backup (adjust path as needed)
psql -d your_database_name < backup_file.sql
```

## Support

- Check for errors in the migration output
- Verify calculations using the SQL query above
- Compare a few loans to ensure math is correct
- Check remaining balances match: `total_payable - payments_received`

## Next Steps

After running the migration:

1. ✅ All new loans will use the correct calculation automatically
2. ✅ Existing loans now have correct values
3. ✅ Payment receipts will display accurate totals
4. ✅ Reports will show correct financial data
